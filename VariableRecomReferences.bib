abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally African species, has
recently spread throughout the world, associated with human
activity. The species has served as the focus of many studies
investigating local adaptation relating to latitudinal variation
in non-African populations, especially those from the United
States and Australia. These studies have documented the
existence of shared, genetically determined phenotypic clines
for several life history and morphological traits. However,
there are no studies designed to formally address the degree of
shared latitudinal differentiation at the genomic level. Here we
present our comparative analysis of such differentiation. Not
surprisingly, we find evidence of substantial, shared selection
responses on the two continents, probably resulting from
selection on standing ancestral variation. The polymorphic
inversion In(3R)P has an important effect on this pattern, but
considerable parallelism is also observed across the genome in
regions not associated with inversion polymorphism.
Interestingly, parallel latitudinal differentiation is observed
even for variants that are not particularly strongly
differentiated, which suggests that very large numbers of
polymorphisms are targets of spatially varying selection in this
species.},

abstract = {A central challenge in the analysis of genetic variation is to
provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples.
Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use
approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage
properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a
substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies
consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take
advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these
problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as
the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact
simulation of the coalescent with recombination for
chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is
possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate
methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more
quickly than with existing methods.},

@article{Cruickshank2014-ps,
abstract = {The metaphor of 'genomic islands of speciation' was first used to
describe heterogeneous differentiation among loci between the
genomes of closely related species. The biological model proposed
to explain these differences was that the regions showing high
levels of differentiation were resistant to gene flow between
species, while the remainder of the genome was being homogenized
by gene flow and consequently showed lower levels of
differentiation. However, the conditions under which such
differentiation can occur at multiple unlinked loci are
restrictive; additionally, essentially, all previous analyses
have been carried out using relative measures of divergence,
which can be misleading when regions with different levels of
recombination are compared. Here, we test the model of
differential gene flow by asking whether absolute divergence is
also higher in the previously identified 'islands'. Using five
species pairs for which full sequence data are available, we find
that absolute measures of divergence are not higher in genomic
islands. Instead, in all cases examined, we find reduced
diversity in these regions, a consequence of which is that
relative measures of divergence are abnormally high. These data
therefore do not support a model of differential gene flow among
loci, although islands of relative divergence may represent loci
involved in local adaptation. Simulations using the program IMa2
further suggest that inferences of any gene flow may be incorrect
in many comparisons. We instead present an alternative
explanation for heterogeneous patterns of differentiation, one in
which postspeciation selection generates patterns consistent with
multiple aspects of the data.},

@article{Kong2010,
abstract = {Meiotic recombinations contribute to genetic diversity by yielding new combinations of alleles. Recently, high-resolution recombination maps were inferred from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture historical recombination events. The use of these maps has been demonstrated by the identification of recombination hotspots and associated motifs, and the discovery that the PRDM9 gene affects the proportion of recombinations occurring at hotspots. However, these maps provide no information about individual or sex differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like natural selection can bias LD-based estimates of recombination rate. Existing genetic maps based on family data avoid these shortcomings, but their resolution is limited by relatively few meioses and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide SNP data from 15,257 parent-offspring pairs to construct the first recombination maps based on directly observed recombinations with a resolution that is effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male and female maps reveals that about 15{\%} of hotspots in one sex are specific to that sex. Although male recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within genes, female recombinations generate more new combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel associations between recombination characteristics of individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of our maps with two LD-based maps inferred from data of HapMap populations of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU) and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) reveal population differences previously masked by noise and map differences at regions previously described as targets of natural selection. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

For these reasons and others, FST has a central role in population and evolutionary genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease association mapping to forensic science.

@article{Slatkin1991,
abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between probabilities of identity by descent and the distribution of coalescence times. By using the relationship between coalescence times and identity probabilities, it is possible to extend existing results for inbreeding coefficients in regular systems of mating to find the distribution of coalescence times and the mean coalescence times. It is also possible to express Sewall Wright's FST as the ratio of average coalescence times of different pairs of genes. That simplifies the analysis of models of subdivided populations because the average coalescence time can be found by computing separately the time it takes for two genes to enter a single subpopulation and time it takes for two genes in the same subpopulation to coalesce. The first time depends only on the migration matrix and the second time depends only on the total number of individuals in the population. This approach is used to find FST in the finite island model and in one-and two-dimensional stepping-stone models. It is also used to find the rate of approach of FST to its equilibrium value. These results are discussed in terms of different measures of genetic distance. It is proposed that, for the purposes of describing the amount of gene flow among local populations, the effective migration rate between pairs of local populations, M{\^{}}, which is the migration rate that would be estimated for those two populations if they were actually in an island model, provides a simple and useful measure of genetic similarity that can be defined for either allozyme or DNA sequence data. {\textcopyright} 1991, Cambridge University Press.
