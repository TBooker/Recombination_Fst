# Coalescent Simulations

In the MS we present results for an island model, but we explored other models too. The list below gives info on the models simulated. 

* Island Model - 100 demes with symmetric migration
* 1-dimensional cline - 100 demes with migration limited to nearest neighbours
* 1-dimensional ring - The same as the cline, except that the ends join up
* Isolation/Migration - 2 demes that exchange migrants at equal rates

The script entitled planeScript.py is a python3 script that implements the msprime simulations and analysis of the data described in the paper.

It is called planeScript.py because I wrote most of it on a plane.
